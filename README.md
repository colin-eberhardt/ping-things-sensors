# To Use

Essentially, just run `yarn start` in the `sensor-app` dir.

Once the app is up, you'll see a very basic home page. 

Go to `Sensors` to view some sensor metadata. From this componenet, you can edit some of the record's metadata. 


# Next Steps

Below are some of the things I would like to implemenet with more time 

## Tests 

With more time, I would've implemented testing. I could've taken a TDD approach here, but I was brainstorming design as I developed. 

Exampes of tests would be tests for:
- Custom components
- Componenet functions
- Reducer 

## Additional Features

To augment this application, I would like to add features such as a dashboard to allow the user to explore and visualize sensor data, some alerts/notifications regarding sensor health, and improvements to the sensor metadata viewer/editor.

## Backend

A Django backend would have been nice here in order to create APIs to add, edit and delete sensor records, and to persist those records throughout the servers session. (i.e. we're not losing data on refresh)

## Design

Some design took a backseat to functionality here. I would've liked this to have been prettier.
